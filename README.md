# Emotion-Aware Content Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a novel content recommendation system that focuses on
user comfort rather than pure engagement.

## Key Features
- Emotion detection from user behavior
- Anti-repetition recommendation logic
- Content classification (educational, entertainment, annoying)
- Creator quality ranking
- Exploration–exploitation balance
- Explainable recommendations

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells from top to bottom.
Change user behavior values to simulate different scenarios.

## Note
This is a prototype built for an academic project to demonstrate ideas and logic.
